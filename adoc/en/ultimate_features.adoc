=== Turning off Conflicting Features
--
Some Studio features may conflict with those of IntelliJ Ultimate Edition or some third-party plugins.

For example, to avoid conflicts of gutter icons provided by the CUBA Studio with ones shown by the Ultimate IDEA Spring plugin, do the following:

* Open Main menu > *Settings > Editor > General > Gutter Icons*,
* Uncheck *Injection points* and *Producers for Disposer methods* options,
* Apply the changes.
