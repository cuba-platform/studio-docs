==== Working with Themes

Studio facilitates creation of {main_man_url}/gui_themes.html[theme] extensions and custom themes in your project.

When you create a theme extension or a custom theme, a special directory structure in the `themes`  subfolder of the *app-web* module is created and new Gradle tasks supporting building the theme are added to the `build.gradle` file.

The created themes will be displayed in the *Themes* section of the project tree.

After extending or creating a theme, you can modify its variables manually in the SCSS file or in the visual editor:

* In the context menu of the new theme select *Open Variables File* item.
* From the main menu: *CUBA* -> *Advanced* -> *Manage themes* -> *Edit %ThemeName% Theme Variables*.
