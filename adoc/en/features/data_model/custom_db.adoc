==== Integrating with Custom Database

As described in the {main_man_url}/arbitrary_dbms.html[documentation], the framework allows you to use any DBMS supported by EclipseLink ORM as your project database. And Studio can help you to create files required for such integration.

Select *CUBA > Advanced > Define Custom Database* in the menu.

The opened window allows you to set properties for a new custom database that you want to work with. Based on these properties, Studio will generate code to support the database both at design and run time.

* *DB type id* - the identifier of the database type to use in the `cuba.dbmsType` application property.
* *DB type name* - a user-friendly name of the database type to show in Studio.

After you click *OK*, Studio will generate Java classes in `com.haulmont.cuba.core.sys.persistence` and Groovy classes in `com.haulmont.studio.db.{db_id}` packages of your project. The sample auto-generated implementation is suitable for Microsoft SQLServer database. You should change it appropriately.

First, fix the `com.haulmont.studio.db.{db_id}.{db_id}DbProperties` class. When it is ready to fit your database, you will be able to switch your project to this database in Studio. Reopen the project to see your database in the Database type drop-down list.

In order to connect to your database at runtime, fix `{db_id}DbmsFeatures` and `{db_id}DbTypeConverter` classes of the `com.haulmont.cuba.core.sys.persistence` package. The `{db_id}SequenceSupport` class is used only for generating integer identifiers and unique numbers.

Finally, fix the `com.haulmont.studio.db.{db_id}.{db_id}DdlGenerator` class for correct generation of *init* and *update* database scripts by Studio, if needed. Skip this step if you don't need to generate DDL scripts for this database.

If you use the custom database as a main data store, when you generate database scripts, Studio will create *init* scripts for all application components, including CUBA. These scripts wonâ€™t include some required initialization data, so you have to add the following to the *Init data* script of your project (`30.create-db.sql`):
