. A new *Handlers* tab has been added to the Screen Designer, next to Palette and Properties.
It displays existing methods along with all possible options for event listeners and component delegates associated with the selected component.
In order to generate necessary handler method - just double-click the corresponding row.

. *Preview* action has been added to the top actions panel of the screen descriptor.
It opens a window with the preview of the edited screen. Canvas of the preview window interacts with the XML editor and automatically updates its content according to the layout changes.

. Added *Inject to controller* and *Go to XML* actions to the context menu in the Screen Designer hierarchy tree.

. Added *CUBA Documentation* actions to the context menu of the hierarchy tree and components palette. These actions open the corresponding component's section in the CUBA Developer's Manual.

. *Add Column* button has been added to the Properties tab of the *Form* component.

. Added class name auto completion for the *class* field in the *Validator* and *Formatter* Screen Designer dialogs.

. Added scaffolding for various application event listeners. It is accessible in two ways:
.. Open existing Spring Bean and press *Subscribe to event* in the top actions panel of the source code editor.
.. In the *Middleware* section of the CUBA project tree invoke a right click -> *New* -> *Event Listener* context menu item.

. Added project-wide options affecting screen generation. These settings are used by the *New* -> *Screen...* wizard.
To change the settings, open Main Menu -> *CUBA* -> *Settings* -> *Screen Generation Settings*.
The following screen settings are available:
.. Form field width (450px by default) - used by entity editors
.. Keep editor actions at the bottom - used by entity editors that are opened as a "full screen" (not as dialog)
.. Force modal open type for editors - used by entity editors opened as a dialog

. Added ability to specify menu item caption in the screen creation wizard.

. Added ability to scaffold handlers for components which don't have *id* yet. Studio asks user to enter component id when required.

. *Main Menu* action has been added to the actions panel of the screen controller. It allows developer to include current screen to the main menu or to navigate to the main menu configuration.

. Build WAR and UberJAR UI in the Deployment section of the CUBA project tree has been improved. From now you can build WAR or UberJar just by double-clicking the corresponding element *Build WAR* or *Build UberJAR*, if building the corresponding artifact is turned on. Configuration files related to these artifacts (`single-war-web.xml`, `logback.xml`, `jetty-env.xml` etc) are now shown near to the *WAR/UberJAR Settings* project tree elements for convenient access.

. Added new actions that allow developer to create new database init/update scripts. These actions are available from the CUBA project tree, under the *Data Stores* -> *Main Data Store* section:
.. init -> context menu -> *New* -> *Database init script*
.. update -> context menu -> *New* -> *Database update script*

. The *Install Delegate* dialog that is invoked from the screen controller now allows developer to generate a formatter, custom column generator or value provider for any table column.

. Added suggestions for the *icon* attribute of the screen XML descriptor, also added icon preview as a gutter icon.
+

. Added suggestions for the *optionsEnum* XML descriptor attribute of the `LookupField` component.

. *Quick Documentation* popup invoked for UI components now provides a link to the CUBA documentation:
+

. Localized Message dialog in the Entity Designer now automatically constructs message keys for Bean Validation messages, e.g. "playground_Rank.queueSize.validation.Digits" or "playground_Tariff.taxType.validation.NotNull".

. Added support for the *Integrated Security* option of the *Microsoft SQL Server (2012+)* database type. Please note that it's available only for projects based on CUBA 7.1.0 and later.

. Performance for large projects has been improved (data model designer, views.xml static analysis, CUBA project tree).

. Oldest compatible IntelliJ IDEA version has been increased to *2019.1*. This means that if you are using an older IDEA (or CUBA Studio) version, you will not be able to update your CUBA plugin to newer releases; you would need to upgrade your IDEA or CUBA Studio installation.

. Numerous small improvements and bug fixes:
