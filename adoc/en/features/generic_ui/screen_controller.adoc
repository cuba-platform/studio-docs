[[screen_controller]]
==== Working with Screen Controllers

This section describes the features that Studio provides for working with the source code of {main_man_url}/screen_controllers.html[screen controllers].

Gutter icons enable quick switching to the corresponding XML descriptor, locating the XML definition of an injected component and other navigation options.

[[controller_injection]]
Dependency injection::
+
--
Dependency injection is the main way of getting references to visual components and API endpoints in the screen controller code. Of course, you can write a field of the required type and annotate it manually, but Studio has a special window that allows you to select an object from the list and create the appropriate field automatically. This window is opened if you press Alt+Insert (Cmd+N) and select *Inject...* in the *Generate* popup menu:

The following objects can be injected into controllers:

* Visual and data components defined in the XML descriptor,
* Screen API interfaces,
* Infrastructure interfaces,
* Middleware services,
* Configuration interfaces.

[[controller_events]]
Event handling::
+
--
By creating event handlers, you can execute code at various points in the screen lifecycle and react to user actions. A handler is a controller method annotated with `@Subscribe` and having the event as a parameter. You can create such method in Studio if you press Alt+Insert (Cmd+N) and select *Subscribe to Event* in the *Generate* popup menu:

Each event in the window is provided with a description on the right which is extracted from the event's Javadoc.

The following events are available in the opened window:

* Controller events represent the lifecycle of the screen.

* Components events allow you to react on buttons clicks, table selections, actions etc.

* Frame events represent the lifecycle of the outer frame component of this screen.

* Data context events allow you to react on the data context changes and execute code before and after data commit.

* Data containers events enable receiving notifications on changes in the state of data containers and entities.

[[controller_delegates]]
Delegates::
+
--
Using delegates, you can provide code that will be used by various screen mechanisms instead of their standard implementations. For example, you can provide your own function to commit data or to select icons for table rows.

A delegate is a controller method with a specific signature and annotated with `@Install`. You can create such method in Studio if you press Alt+Insert (Cmd+N) and select *Install Delegate* in the *Generate* popup menu:

Each event in the window is provided with a description on the right which is extracted from the framework Javadocs.
