Version 10::
+
--
. Code editors of entities, screen controllers and screen descriptors now have a panel on top which provides quick access to CUBA-related actions and navigation between related files. For example, below is the panel in an entity class editor:
+
image::release_notes/v-10-actions-panel.png[align="center"]
+
Using the panel buttons you can quickly navigate to the related DDL scripts, views and screens. Also, you can create new views, screens and JPA lifecycle callback methods.
+
The actions are also duplicated in the "intentions" context menu which is invoked by pressing Alt+Enter (Option+Enter):

. Implemented scaffolding of `EntityChangedEvent` listeners. In order to run it, select an entity class, package, or the top-level *Middleware* node in the CUBA project tree and click the *New > EntityChangedEvent Listener* context menu item. Studio will create a Spring bean in the `core` module with two listener methods: one notified before and another after transaction commit.

. Implemented scaffolding of JMX beans. In order to run it, select the *Middleware* node or one of the packages under the *Beans* node in the CUBA project tree and click the *New > JMX Bean* item of the context menu.

. Implemented scaffolding of configuration interfaces. In order to run it, select the *Project > Config Interfaces* node in the CUBA project tree and click the *New > Configuration Interface* item of the context menu.

. The *Inject* dialog now contains the *Project Beans* section which allows you to inject any Spring bean available in the project.

. The *Inject* dialog now works for screen controllers written in Groovy too.

. Improved injection experience: now if you put the cursor inside a method and invoke the *Inject* dialog, the resulting field will be generated on top of the class definition and the field name will be automatically copied to the cursor.

. *Inject component into controller* intention is available on the XML element of the component. Try to position cursor on a component XML element and press Alt+Enter (Option+Enter).

. Implemented visual designer for entity indexes and unique constraints. See the *Indexes* tab at the bottom of the entity editor.

. Implemented inspections about duplicated entity name and table name. They are shown on the entity class if the same entity name or table name is defined for more than one entity class.

. Implemented intentions for adding correct JPA annotations to entity fields. It simplifies manual coding of entity attributes: you can just add a field to the entity class, generate getters/setters, and then press Alt+Enter (Option+Enter) on the field to generate annotations.

. In the screen controller code, you will get a warning if you inject a screen component not present in the screen's XML:
+

. In the entity class code, you will get a warning if the class has no `@NamePattern` annotation:
+
image::release_notes/v-10-warn-namepattern.png[align="center"]
+
You can fix the problem or suppress the warning by pressing Alt+Enter (Option+Enter) on the class name.

. View designer now has a master-detail layout with the list of views on the left and the selected view editor on the right.

. For projects based on CUBA 7.1 and above, the following features have been added:
.. Main screen templates with side menu and responsive side menu.
.. Support for passing properties to screens and fragments opened declaratively.
.. Support for REST API add-on.

. All Resolved Issues:

Version 9::
+
--
. BREAKING CHANGE: Studio now uses HSQL version 2.4.1. When you open a project using HSQL database, Studio prompts you to update the version of HSQL in the project's `build.gradle`. If you accept, the project will correctly work with the Studio v.9+. However, be aware of the following issues:
.. The application will not start if the project with the new HSQL driver is opened in a previous Studio version containing the older HSQL server;
.. In the projects with HSQL based on CUBA version before 7.1, Scheduled Tasks do not work because their table has a column named `PERIOD` which is a reserved word in HSQL 2.4.1. The column is renamed in CUBA 7.1.
+
[TIP]
====
If you are on CUBA 7.0 or below and need to work with HSQL and Scheduled Tasks at development time, you can make Studio to use HSQL 2.2.9 by following these steps:

. Exit Studio.

. Copy `cuba-studio` folder:
** on Windows from `C:\Program Files\Haulmont\CUBA Studio 2018.3\plugins\` to `%userprofile%\.CubaStudio2018.3\config\plugins\`
** on macOS from `/Applications/CUBA Studio.app/Contents/plugins/` to `~/Library/Application Support/CubaStudio2018.3/`

. Replace `hsqldb-2.4.1.jar` file with `hsqldb-2.2.9.jar` in the copied `cuba-studio/lib` folder. You can download the file http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.2.9/hsqldb-2.2.9.jar[here].

. Start Studio and open your project.

. Replace `def hsql = 'org.hsqldb:hsqldb:2.4.1'` with `def hsql = 'org.hsqldb:hsqldb:2.2.9'` in the `build.gradle`.

Now both Studio and your project will use HSQL 2.2.9 and the application based on CUBA 7.0 and below can work with Scheduled Tasks on HSQL.
====

. Hot deploy mechanism now deploys all dependent classes together with the changed one, which eliminates `ClassCastException` on opening modified screens.

. When selecting MySQL or Oracle database, Studio shows a dialog where you can click a link for downloading the JDBC driver from the vendor website and then upload it from the local file system to the correct locations in the project and Studio itself. After uploading a driver, restart Studio.
+
The drivers can be removed from Studio using the *CUBA > Database Proprietary Drivers* settings page.

. `DataGrid` and `TreeDataGrid` are available for browser and master-detail screen templates in the *Table type* field of the *Create CUBA Screen* wizard.

. *Extend an existing screen* and *Entity fragment* templates have been added to the *Create CUBA Screen* wizard.

. Undo/Redo actions now work correctly in the screen visual designer.

. Implemented auto-complete for data loader query in the screen designer.

. Screen designer now has a button in the canvas top right corner to switch to the screen controller.

. Warnings in screen XML when `invoke` and `datasource` attributes are used in screens based on new API.

. If you have added Groovy support in the *Project Properties* window, you can select Groovy in the *Advanced > Controller language* field of the *Create CUBA Screen* wizard.

. Services written in Groovy are shown in CUBA project tree.

. Notification about new platform versions on project opening.

. Refined gutter icons in source code editor.

. Entity attribute type can now be freely changed in the entity designer with or without refactoring.

. Enumeration designer has been implemented.

. View designer has been rewritten with native IntelliJ UI.

. Data model generator now contains screen templates based on the new API.

. All Resolved Issues:

Version 8::
+
--
. Opening of a project for the first time is now performed through the import wizard. See <<open_project>> for details.

. The project model is now stored in a file inside the `.idea` folder, so the Gradle synchronization is not started each time the project is opened.

. The *Run/Debug Configuration* editor now allows you to select a JDK to be used for running the application server. See *JVM* field on the *Configuration* tab. The value of `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is used by default.

. Views can be renamed by the standard *Refactor > Rename* action. This action can be invoked on the view element in the CUBA project tree, on the `name` attribute of the view XML definition in the `views.xml` file, and on any reference to this view in the screen XML descriptors.

. A view editor can be invoked from the *view* field of a data container in the screen designer.

. Implemented auto-complete and usage reference for `screen` attribute of the `<fragment>` XML element in screen descriptors.

. Implemented localized message editor for menu captions. Click *Generic UI > Web Menu* in the CUBA project tree, switch to the *Structure* tab, select a menu item and click *edit* in the *Caption* field.

. Implemented warning for enum values without localized captions. If you see the warning, use the *Create message in the message bundle* quick fix to create a default caption.

. Implemented auto-complete for the names of the application properties declared in configuration interfaces. Press Ctrl+Space when defining a property in `app.properties` or `web-app.properties` files.

Version 7::
+
--
. If your project is based on CUBA 6.10 and uses BPM, Charts, Full-Text Search or Reports premium add-ons, you should set the premium repository access credentials in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` as described in the {main_man_url}/access_to_repo.html#access_to_premium_repo[Developer's Manual]. Studio does not pass the credentials to Gradle.
