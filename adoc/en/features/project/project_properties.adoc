[[project_properties]]
==== Project Properties Editor

The *Project Properties* editor allows you to configure your project. You can open it from the *CUBA* main menu or by double-clicking the *Project > Properties* item of the project tree.

Basic settings::
+
--

* The *Repositories* field display the repositories currently used in the project. Studio scans these repositories to discover what platform versions are available. Use the buttons next to the field to configure the access to repository. For more details see {main_man_url}/access_to_repo.html[documentation]. You can also manually register in `build.gradle` any number of additional repositories containing application components.

* The *Platform version* field allows you to select a version of the platform. If you choose a newer version, an automatic migration will be performed if required.

* *Groovy support* checkbox enables Groovy code within the application: for example, in screen controller classes.

* The *App components* group allows you to specify additional platform components that will be used in your project.
Custom application components are managed in a separate <<add_ons,CUBA Add-ons>> window.

* If you need to change the path to the application server, specify the new path in the *Tomcat path* field. The next execution of `gradlew deploy` or `gradlew start` will install Tomcat into that location.

* The *Tomcat ports* group allows you to assign non-standard ports for the Tomcat application server installed in the `deploy/tomcat` folder as a result of {main_man_url}/fast_deployment.html[fast deployment].

* In particular, the *HTTP port* field affects the port Tomcat is listening on for HTTP connection, as well as `cuba.webPort`, `cuba.webAppUrl`, `cuba.restApiUrl` and `cuba.connectionUrlList` application properties.

* In the *AJP port* field, you can set the port for AJP Connector.

* In the *Shutdown port* field, you can set the port Tomcat is listening on for SHUTDOWN command.

* In the *Debug port* field, you can set the port Tomcat is listening on for Java debugger connection. If you change this port, you should also change it in the debug configuration of your IDE.

* *Available locales* field allows you to set {main_man_url}/localization.html[locales] used in your application. Open the locales editor by clicking the button next to the field. The *Locale select visible* checkbox located in the editor window controls the value of the {main_man_url}/app_properties_reference.html#cuba.localeSelectVisible[cuba.localeSelectVisible] application property. The editor also enables defining or overriding format strings for {main_man_url}/datatype.html[parsing and formatting data].

[[project_properties_dependencies]]
Dependencies section::
+
--
The *Dependencies* section displays and allows to manage 3rd-party dependencies (libraries) connected to your project.

image::features/project/dependencies.png[align="center"]

Project dependencies are displayed in a table grouped by module into three or more sections,
depending on how many modules your project consists of.
If library is added to *global* module - it effectively becomes globally accessible in the project,
because all other CUBA project's modules depend on the global module.

The *Type* column in the table shows dependency type:

* *compile* - library is used for compilation and runtime
* *provided* - for dependencies that are necessary to compile your production code
but shouldn't be part of the runtime classpath (JDBC drivers, Servlet API implementation etc.)
* *runtime* - library is only used in runtime
* *testCompile* - library is used to compile and run tests
* *testRuntime* - library is used by tests, only in runtime

The *Text* column displays library coordinates in the format of Gradle dependency string: *"group:name:version"*.

Dependency management actions are located right of the dependencies table:

* *Add dependency* - add new dependency to your project. Specify Maven dependency declaration or Gradle dependency string.
The dialog automatically validates that dependency declaration is correct.
* *Remove dependency* - remove dependency from your project.
* *Edit dependency* - change dependency declaration text.

Read more about 3rd-party dependencies in the
{gradle_user_guide_url}/building_java_projects.html#sec:java_dependency_management_overview[Gradle documentation].

Adding new 3rd-party dependency::
+
--
Adding a 3rd-party dependency to your project requires the following steps:

* Find out *Maven* dependency declaration or *Gradle dependency string* for the required library.

image::features/project/newdep-gradle.png[align="center"]
image::features/project/newdep-maven.png[align="center"]

* Copy dependency declaration into the clipboard
* Open *Project Properties* dialog
* Choose the module to attach the dependency to, or use *global* module to make the library globally available in the project.
* Press *+* button right of the *Dependencies* table. The *Dependency Editor* dialog opens.
Dependency declaration from the clipboard is automatically pasted into the text area.
* Click *OK* in the Dependency Editor dialog. Fix the declaration if validation errors are prompted.
* Click *OK* in the *CUBA Project Properties* dialog to apply the changes. Studio will add necessary declarations
to the project build script and refresh project configuration.
* Now you can use library's classes in your code.

[TIP]
====
Gradle *implementation 'a.b.c'* dependency type is not supported yet, please use *compile 'a.b.c'* instead of it.
