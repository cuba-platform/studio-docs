==== Working with Views

To create a new {main_man_url}/views.html[view] for an entity, select the entity in the project tree and click *New > View* in the context menu.

The view designer will be opened. It contains the following fields:

* *Entity name* - the name of the entity the view is created for.
* *Name* - the name of the new view.
* *Extends* - a built-in or custom view which attributes are extended by the new view. There are three built-in views available for any entity:
** `_local` contains all local attributes of an entity (the attributes which are not references to other entities),
** `_minimal` contains the attributes listed in the name pattern,
** `_base` includes all local non-system attributes and attributes defined by `@NamePattern` (effectively `_minimal` + `_local`).
* *Configuration file* - a {main_man_url}/views.xml.html[views configuration file] to store this view. By default, Studio generates a single `views.xml` file in the `global` module.

The full list of attributes of the current entity is displayed in the tree below the fields. You can select which attributes will be included in the view by setting the checkboxes accordingly.

If your view extends another view, all inherited attributes are selected with the checkboxes disabled.

If you select a reference attribute, the following properties will appear in the right panel:

* *Entity* - the referenced entity name.
* *View* - an optional view to load the referenced entity. It is recommended to use references to named views instead of ad-hoc graph of view attributes, as it makes it easier to maintain complex views. Also, even if you define a view name, you can still add attributes not included in this view by setting the checkboxes in the tree.
* *Fetch* - an optional property of reference attributes, specifies how to fetch the related entity from the database. See {main_man_url}/views.html[documentation] for details.

When you click *OK* and close the designer, you can find the new view in the project tree under the entity:

If you double-click the view item in the project tree, Studio will open `views.xml` in the code editor and position the cursor on the view definition. The code editor has two tabs at the bottom: *Text* and *Structure*. The latter displays the list of views defined in this configuration file.

When editing a view definition in XML, use Ctrl+Space for auto-completion of attribute names:

and pay attention to highlighted attributes, most probably they do not exist:

You can open the graphical designer for a view in a number of ways:

* Select the view in the project tree and click the *Edit View* context menu item.

* Position the cursor on the view element in the configuration file code, press Alt+Enter (Option+Enter), select *Edit view* in the popup menu and press enter.

* Switch to the *Structure* tab of the configuration file code editor, select the view and click *Edit* button.
