==== Creating Integration Tests
--
CUBA applications can be tested using well-known approaches: unit, integration and UI testing. Studio provides developer with support for the following categories of tests:

* {main_man_url}/integration_tests_mw.html[Middleware integration tests]. This category of tests is used to test middleware functionality: services, beans, event listeners, logic of the ORM and communicating with the database. Middleware tests run in a fully functional Spring container connected to the database.
* {main_man_url}/integration_tests_client.html[Web integration tests]. Those run in the Spring container of the Web Client block. Web test container works independently from the middleware, and the framework creates stubs for all middleware services.

Both groups of tests are displayed in the *Business Logic* -> *Tests* section of the CUBA project tree, grouped by module:

In order to create a new integration test, select the *Business Logic* -> *Tests* project tree section and click *New* -> *Integration Test (Middleware)* or *Integration Test (Web)* in the context menu:

If your project doesn't yet contain test source root or test container, Studio will show an additional confirmation dialog before creating necessary files and classes.

In the appearing dialog you need to enter the following parameters:

* *Class Name* - name of the test class.
* *Package* - package to place test class into.
* *Test container class* - name of the test container class. Default `Common` container is created automatically for you, but you can also create other container classes, e.g. to test your application using another DBMS type.
* *Testing library* - choose between *JUnit5* or *JUnit4*. Note that CUBA projects which were created using previous platform versions up to 7.1 support only *JUnit4*, even if they were migrated to CUBA 7.2.
