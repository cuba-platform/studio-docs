== Installation

Before installing CUBA Studio, make sure your system meets the requirements explained in the {main_man_url}/setup.html[Setup] section of the CUBA Developer's Manual.

You can install CUBA Studio in two different forms: as a standalone IDE for your operating system or as a plugin for existing IntelliJ IDEA. The Studio standalone IDE is a special build of IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition which includes the CUBA plugin. If you haven't used IntelliJ IDEA before, we recommend using the standalone IDE.

The IDE has a version corresponding to the IntelliJ IDEA in use, for example {idea-version}. The CUBA plugin has its own version starting from {plugin-version}.

Installers of the standalone IDE for Windows, macOS and Linux can be downloaded from {cuba-download-site}. The plugin is available in the IntelliJ plugins repository (see <<install_plugin,below>>).

Configure Gradle proxy settings::
+
--
* Find the *~/.gradle/gradle.properties* file in the user home directory
* Edit this file and add required proxy parameters as described in the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy[Gradle documentation]:

[source, java]
----                  
include::{sourcesdir}/gradle-proxy.properties[]
----
--

Configure Git proxy settings (optional)::
+

You might want to configure proxy settings for the Git version control tool as well, e.g. to download sample projects from one of the CUBA https://github.com/cuba-platform?utf8=âœ“&q=sample&type=&language=[GitHub repositories]:

Consider to run this command:
[source]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/git-proxy.txt[]
----

Or refer to the https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-httpproxy[Git documentation] for more details.

[[gradle_offline_mode]]
=== Working Offline
--
It is possible to develop projects using Studio without internet connection, provided that all project dependencies have been already downloaded, i.e. the project was already opened and assembled by this Studio installation. Part of Studio functionality will not be available in offline mode, e.g. it will not be possible to change the platform version or browse CUBA Add-Ons Marketplace.

To start working offline, open the *Gradle* tool window in the right part of the IDE and click the *Toggle Offline Mode* button:

image::gradle-offline-mode.png[align="center"]

In offline mode, Gradle uses dependencies from the cache when executing all project build tasks. Gradle will not attempt to access the network to perform dependency resolution. If the required dependencies are not present in the cache, build execution will fail.

[[install_plugin_nonstandard]]
=== Non-Standard Studio Builds
