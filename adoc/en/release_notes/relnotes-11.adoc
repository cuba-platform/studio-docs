Version 11::
+
--
. The "CUBA Add-ons" screen has been added which allows to manage add-ons included in your project.
The screen can be opened by double-clicking *Project* -> *Add-ons* in the CUBA project tree,
or from the main menu: *CUBA* -> *Marketplace*.
Detailed description of the screen is available in the <<add_ons,corresponding section>>.

. The <<welcome_screen,Welcome screen>> has been added.
It simplifies access to common project settings and actions, holds links to documentation and community web pages.

. Implemented UI to manage 3rd-party libraries used by the project.
It is available in the <<project_properties_dependencies,Project Properties Editor>>.

. The Entity Designer has been re-implemented using native IntelliJ UI components. New designer has the following benefits:
.. Better responsiveness, faster opening time
.. Changes to the entity and its attributes are instantly committed into the source code
.. Integration with IntelliJ smart refactorings such as *Safe Delete* of entity attributes
+

. Implemented *Safe Delete* refactoring of entity attributes.
To start this refactoring, remove the attribute in the entity designer
or right-click the attribute declaration and choose from the context menu: *Refactor* -> *Safe Delete...*.
This refactoring searches for attribute usages in views, screens and other configuration files.
It automatically removes attribute usages that are safe to delete and warns about usages in the code that would need manual repair.

. Data Store settings have been moved out from the *Project Properties* screen.
From now Data Store settings are available for viewing and editing in the CUBA project tree -> *Data Stores* section.
Main Data Store settings also can be opened from main menu: *CUBA* -> *Main Data Store Settings*.
Please refer to the <<data_stores,Managing Data Stores>> section for more details.

. An ability to use *HSQLDB InMemory* as an additional data store has been added.

. Added support for https://mariadb.org/[MariaDB] as a main or additional data store.

. Added support for https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/[Amazon Redshift] as an additional data store.

. *Add attribute* action has been added to the actions panel of the entity source code editor.
+

. Actions supporting `EntityChangedEvent` listeners have been added to the actions panel of the entity source code editor.
They allow you to create new listener or to navigate to already existing listener methods.
+

. The *Create CUBA EntityChangedEvent Listener* scaffolding dialog has been improved.
Now it allows you to create several listener methods in one class and to choose two additional event phases.
+

. Added support for more BeanValidation 2.0 annotations in the Entity designer: `@NotEmpty`, `@Positive`, `@PastOrPresent` and others.

. When adding attributes to an entity, the entity designer automatically recognizes attribute name that can be displayed as instance caption
(`name`, `caption`, `title` etc) and generates
{main_man_url}/entity_class_annotations.html#namePattern_annotation[@NamePattern annotation]
if it hasn't been defined yet.

. View designer is now able to rename an already existing view, migrating its usages in the code.

. The *Inject 'xxx'* quick fix which allows you to inject bean based on variable name has been extended to work in the context of both screen controllers and Spring beans.
The example how one can utilize this quick fix is presented below:
+
image::release_notes/v-11-inject-before.png[align="center"]
+
image::release_notes/v-11-inject-after.png[align="center"]
+
To utilize this feature, type variable name of the desired bean in the code of a Spring bean or a CUBA screen controller.
Then press Alt+Enter and choose *Inject 'beanName'* suggestion in the popup list.
Class name of the bean is determined automatically based on variable name which must exactly match bean interface name.
For example: `dataManager`, `fileStorageService`, `messageBundle` and `clusterManagerAPI` variable names will be recognized and successfully injected as corresponding CUBA beans.

. Added a Java code inspection checking that localization messages targeted by `getMessage` and `formatMessage` method calls exist.
+
image::release_notes/v-11-message-quick-fix.png[align="center"]
+
Checks are performed for `getMessage` and `formatMessage` methods of `MessageBundle`, `Messages` and `AbstractWindow` (legacy screens) classes.
If the message with given key in a given message pack does not exist, message key is highlighted in red.
+
If you press Alt+Enter and choose *Create message in the message bundle* quick fix item,
Studio will open *Localization Message* dialog to input localized message for all configured project locales.

. Standalone IDE version of the Studio has been upgraded to IntelliJ Community platform *2019.1*.
Previously downloaded standalone Studio IDE will not be upgraded - you should download new version from the
{cuba-download-site}[CUBA Platform] web site.

. CUBA plugin for IntelliJ IDEA containing this release of the Studio has been uploaded to the main (Stable) plugins channel.
So it's not necessary to set up additional plugins repository anymore.
If you have used previous versions of CUBA Studio plugin, you can now remove
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/haulmont/list from the list of *Custom Plugin Repositories*.
Custom repositories list is located here: *File* -> *Settings* -> *Plugins* -> "gear" icon -> *Manage Plugin Repositories*.

. Numerous small improvements and bug fixes:
