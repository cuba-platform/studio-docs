==== Creating Role Definitions
--

You can create new design-time role definitions by right-clicking the *Security* section and choosing the *New* -> *Role* context menu action. The *New Role* dialog appears:

* *Role Name* - enter the name of the role. It is a technical name that can be used later in the code.
* *Class* - enter the name of the class defining the role. It will be filled automatically after you enter role name.
* *Security Scope* - choose which type of the client role permissions should be applied to:
** *GENERIC_UI* - permissions are applied to the {main_man_url}/gui_framework.html[Generic User Interface].
** *REST* - permissions are applied to the {restapi_man_url}[REST API] client.

After clicking *OK* the role definition class will be created. You can specify role permissions manually in the source code by using rules explained in the {main_man_url}/roles.html#roles_design_time[corresponding section] of the Developer's Manual. Users with active CUBA Studio subscription can construct role definition by using a visual designer.
