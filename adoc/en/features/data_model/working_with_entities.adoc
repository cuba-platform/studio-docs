[[data_model_entities]]
==== Working with Entities

[[data_model_entity]]
Creating new entity::
+
--
. Select *Data Model* section or a package below it in the project tree and choose *New > Entity* from the context menu.

. The *New CUBA Entity* dialog appears. Enter the name of the entity class in the *Entity name* field, select the type of the entity and its id.

. Studio will create the entity class and register it in `persistence.xml` or `metadata.xml`, depending on the entity type. The created class will be opened in the source code editor. Three tabs will be displayed at the bottom of the editor:

** *Text* contains the source code.

** *Designer* shows the entity designer where you can configure the entity and its attributes using graphical interface instead of writing Java code.

** *DDL Preview* contains the read-only DDL code of the corresponding table and its referential constraints.

[[data_model_attribute]]
Creating entity attributes::
+
--
There are multiple ways of adding an attribute to an entity.

* Using graphical interface of entity designer: switch to the *Designer* tab, click *New* below the *Attributes* table and fill the required fields in the *New Attribute* window.
+
The globe button in the right part of the *Name* field lets you immediately set a user-friendly name of the attribute. It is stored in the `messages.properties` file and used by default in UI components. If you have defined multiple languages for your application, you can specify the localized name for all languages.

* Using a separate window opened from the source code, using the button
Position the cursor below the last existing field and press Alt+Insert (Cmd+N).
In the *Generate* menu, select *Add Attribute...*. Studio will show the *New Attribute* window as it would be opened from the graphical designer.
The same window can be opened by clicking the *Add attribute* button located in the code editor actions panel.

* You can also write attribute fields by hand, generate getters and setters, and then select *JPA Annotations* in the *Generate* menu to add JPA annotations with default parameters.

Studio can help you to add the new attribute to UI screens created for this entity. Position the cursor to the line containing the attribute and press Alt+Enter (Option+Enter) or click the light bulb icon and select *Add entity attribute to screens*:

Press Enter, and Studio will open a dialog with the list of screens working with the edited entity. You can select a screen and Studio will add the attribute to the appropriate UI components of this screen, for example to a table or a form.
--

[[data_model_name_pattern]]
Creating the instance name::
+
--
An entity that can be used as a reference attribute of another entity (for example `Customer` can be an attribute of `Order`) requires a pattern to generate the meaningful name of an instance. This pattern is defined by the {main_man_url}/entity_class_annotations.html#namePattern_annotation[@NamePattern] annotation on the entity class. It can be created in Studio if you position the cursor on the class name, click Alt+Enter (Option+Enter) and select *Add name pattern* (this item is shown only if the entity has no `@NamePattern` annotation):

image::features/data_model/create_name_pattern.png[align="center"]

Press Enter, and Studio will show the list of all entity attributes. Select one or several attributes and press Enter. Studio will generate the `@NamePattern` on the entity class.
--

[[data_model_messages]]
Creating messages for new attributes::
+
--
When you create a new entity attribute manually, its name will be highlighted to remind you of creating a user-friendly attribute name in the corresponding message pack:

image::features/data_model/create_message_1.png[align="center"]

Click Alt+Enter (Option+Enter) on the highlighted attribute and select *Create message in the message bundle*:

--

[[remove_entity]]
Removing entities::
+
--
When you remove an entity class, use the *Safe delete* option to find and clean up references to this entity:

image::features/data_model/remove_entity.png[align="center"]

Some references like usages in `persistence.xml` and `metadata.xml` files will be deleted automatically. If there are other references, you will see a dialog that shows these references. Click *View Usages* in the dialog, review the references in the *Find* tool window and click *Cancel* or *Do Refactor*.
