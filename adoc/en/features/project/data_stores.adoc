==== Managing Data Stores

Main Data Store::
+
--
The *Main Data Store Properties* dialog displays settings of the main data store.
It can be opened:

* by double-clicking *Project* -> *Data Stores* -> *Main Data Store* in the CUBA project tree
* from main menu: *CUBA* -> *Main Data Store Settings...*
--

[[data_stores_properties]]
Data Store Properties::
+
--
The following properties are available both for Main and Additional data stores:

* *Define JDBC DataSource in* - determines which component is responsible to create connection pool to the database (available for projects based on CUBA 7.2 or later). Available values are *Application* and *JNDI*.
** *Application* - connection pool is created and managed by the CUBA platform using the https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[HikariCP] library. This is the recommended DataSource mode.
** *JNDI* - connection pool is created by the application server and put into JNDI. CUBA application obtains the data source from the JNDI registry by its JNDI name.
* *Database type* - {main_man_url}/dbms_types.html[type of the database server]. Studio supports *PostgreSQL*, *Microsoft SQL Server*, *Oracle*, *MySQL*, *MariaDB*, *Amazon RedShift* and *HSQLDB* out of the box. It is also possible to integrate with other databases if necessary, refer to <<custom_db, this section>> for details.
* *Database URL* - specify host, port and database name.
* *Connection params* - specify other connection parameters. Format of connection parameters depends on the selected DBMS. The string should include a separator between the database name and parameters.
For example, to specify a Microsoft SQL Server 2008+ instance name, use the following string in the field:
+
[source]
----
;instanceName=myinstance
----
+
You can use "pencil" button in the right part of the *Connection params* field to enter connection parameters conveniently. In this case Studio automatically forms connection string by adding DBMS-specific separator characters.
* *Custom database URL* - specify a custom database connection URL. *Host* and *Database* name should be provided in this case, as they are used separately for database creation.
* *Database user* and *Password* - database connection credentials.
* *Integrated Security* - enable the corresponding authentication option when connecting to the *Microsoft SQL Server 2012+* database.

In case of HSQLDB the Studio itself serves the database and stores its files in the `build/hsqldb` directory.

[[data_stores_additional]]
Additional Data Stores::
+
--

In order to create the {main_man_url}/data_store.html[additional data store] in the project,
right-click *Data Stores* item in the CUBA project tree and choose *New* -> *Additional Data Store* context menu item.
Additional data stores registered in the project are displayed as sub-items under the *Data Stores* section:

image::features/project/additional-stores.png[align="center"]

By right-clicking on an additional datastore item, a context menu is opened:

* *Delete Data Store* - remove the data store from the project
* *Edit Data Store* - open the dialog to edit data store settings
* *Generate Model...* - <<generate_model,generate data model>> from the selected data store

The *Data Store* dialog appears when you create or edit an additional data store. It has the following fields:

* *Data store name* - the name of the data store. It may contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores and should be different from the project name.
* *Data store type* - the type of the data store: either `RdbmsStore` or `Custom`, see the {main_man_url}/data_store.html[documentation] for details.
* *DataSource JNDI name* - automatically set by Studio on the basis of the data store name.
* In case of `RdbmsStore` you need to specify additional properties which are described in a section above.

[[data_stores_db_scripts]]
Database init and update scripts::
+
--
{main_man_url}/db_scripts.html[Database init and update scripts] are available for *Main Data Store* and displayed under its element:

image::features/project/db-scripts.png[align="center"]

* *Init* scripts contain DDL and DML statements creating the database from scratch, bringing the database structure to the state consistent with the current state of the data model.
* *Update* scripts contain statements that update already existing database structure to the current state of the data model from any of the previous states.

Studio automatically maintains init and update scripts according to the data model changes, read more about it in the  <<database_migration>> section.

You can also create additional database scripts if necessary. Use the following actions in the CUBA project tree under the *Data Stores* -> *Main Data Store* section:

* init -> context menu -> *New* -> *Database init script*
* update -> context menu -> *New* -> *Database update script*
