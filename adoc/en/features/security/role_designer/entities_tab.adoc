===== Entities Tab
--
The *Entities* tab of the role designer provides editing of the permissions for entities and entity attributes.

The table on the left side of the panel displays entities defined in the project as well as entities inherited from platform and add-ons. Entity list can be filtered by name with help of search text box located above of the table.

A toolbar is displayed above the entities table. It contains the following actions:

* *Show Inherited from Platform and Add-Ons* - toggle to hide or display inherited entities.
* *Show Assigned Only* - toggle to show or hide all entities, including those which don't have permissions defined.

All entity operations are denied by default. Using check boxes in the table you can allow particular operations (*Create*, *Read*, *Update* and *Delete*) for the selected entity.

The table on the right displays attribute permissions for the selected entity. All entity attributes are denied to view and modify by default. By clicking *View* and *Modify* checkboxes you can set desired access level for the selected attribute.

The wildcard image:features/security/wildcard.png[] option in the attributes table allows you to mark all attributes as available for *View* or *Modify*, including those attributes that will be added to the selected entity in the future. Note that you can combine in one entity wildcard *Modify* for most attributes with *View* permission as an exception for a few selected attributes.

[WARNING]
====
Wildcard attribute permissions option is convenient, but you should use it with care. By using it you are assuming that you will never in the future add a new privileged attribute to the selected entity that shouldn't be visible or editable by the current role.
====

The *Allow All* checkbox in the entities table permits all CRUD operations and allows *Modify* for all attributes, making the selected entity fully accessible for the current role.
