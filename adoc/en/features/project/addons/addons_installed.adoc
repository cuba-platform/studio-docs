===== Installed Add-ons

The *Installed* tab displays add-ons that are already connected to the current project.

Installed add-ons are grouped into two categories.
*Marketplace Add-Ons* are those which are installed from CUBA Marketplace.
*Custom Add-Ons* are those which are developed by 3rd parties and hosted in 3rd-party repositories, including local Maven.

In order to detach add-on from your project, select corresponding item in the list and press *Delete*,
or right-click -> *Uninstall*.
Then click *Apply* in the dialog. Studio will remove the add-on from the list of project dependencies and update project configuration.
