===== Installing Add-on Included with Studio Subscription
--
Use this scenario if the commercial add-on has been included together with the CUBA Studio subscription. In this case you have *the same subscription key* both for CUBA Studio premium functionality and for commercial add-ons access.

* Enter your subscription key in the <<subscription_information,Subscription Information>> dialog if you haven't done it before.
* If you were signed in to the <<cuba_user_profile,CUBA user profile>>, *sign out* of the profile
by clicking the *CUBA User Profile* button on the toolbar and clicking the *Logout* button in the dialog. You don't need to be signed in for this subscription scheme.

* Find the required add-on and click *Install* next to it.
