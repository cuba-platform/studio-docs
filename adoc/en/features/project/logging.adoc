==== Logging
--
The *Logging* section of the CUBA project tree serves the following purposes:

* Display log files of the local Tomcat debug server.
* Allow developers to create and edit project-specific logging configuration.

Log files are displayed in two folders reflecting their location in the file system. The same layout can be observed when the application is deployed to the production environment:

* *app_home.logs* - {main_man_url}/logging.html[CUBA log files]. These logs are configured in the `logback.xml` configuration file.
* *tomcat.logs* - https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/logging.html[Tomcat log files]. These logs are configured in the Tomcat.

The `logback.xml` file displayed in this section is a customized logging configuration file located at the `etc/logback.xml` location relative to the project root directory. This file is used as a CUBA logging configuration file for the local debug Tomcat server. The same file will be suggested to be used by default in the <<deployment_war_settings,WAR Settings>> and <<deployment_uber_jar_settings,UberJar Settings>> dialogs. You can create customized logging configuration file by right-clicking the *Logging* CUBA project tree section and choosing the *Generate Logback Configuration File...* item in the context menu:

The generated `logback.xml` file can be customized, e.g. you can add your own appenders and limit logging messages by category. Read more about configuring logback on its http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#syntax[manual page].
