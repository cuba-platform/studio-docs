==== Working with Themes

Studio facilitates creation of {main_man_url}/gui_themes.html[theme] extensions and custom themes in your project.

When you create a theme extension or a custom theme, the special directory structure is created and the `build.gradle` file is modified.

The created themes will be displayed in the *Themes* section of the project tree.

After extending or creating a theme, you can modify its variables manually in the SCSS file or in the visual editor:
in the context menu of the new theme, select *Open Variables File*. This file can also be opened from CUBA main menu: select *Advanced > Manage themes > Edit theme variables*.
