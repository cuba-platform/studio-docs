[[screen_controller]]
==== Working with Screen Controllers

This section describes the features that Studio provides for working with the source code of {main_man_url}/screen_controllers.html[screen controllers].

Gutter icons enable quick switching to the corresponding XML descriptor, locating the XML definition of an injected component and other navigation options.

[[controller_action_panel]]
Top actions panel::
+
--
Actions panel is located on the top of the controller source code editor. It displays the following actions:

* *Descriptor* - navigates to the corresponding screen descriptor.
* *<entity class name>* - navigates to the entity associated with current browser or editor screen.
* *Main Menu* - allows you to include the current screen to the main menu or to navigate to the main menu configuration.
* *Inject* - helps to inject dependencies to the controller class, described below.
* *Generate Handler* - provides subscribing the controller to various events and generating components' delegates, described below.

[[controller_injection]]
Dependency injection::
+
--
Dependency injection is the main way of getting references to visual components and API endpoints in the screen controller code. Of course, you can write a field of the required type and annotate it manually, but Studio has a special window that allows you to select an object from the list and create the appropriate field automatically. This window can be opened:

* by clicking the *Inject* action on the top actions panel,
* or by pressing Alt+Insert (Cmd+N) and selecting *Inject...* in the *Generate* popup menu:

The following objects can be injected into controllers:

* Visual and data components defined in the XML descriptor,
* Screen API interfaces,
* Infrastructure interfaces,
* Middleware services,
* Other Spring beans defined in the project,
* Configuration interfaces,
* SLF4J Logger instance.

[[controller_events_delegates]]
Event handlers and delegates::
+
--
There are two ways to add logic related to the screen lifecycle and components behavior to the screen controller: event handlers and component delegates. These two are implemented differently in the framework but used similarly in the Studio UI.

By creating event handlers you can execute code at various points in the screen lifecycle and react to user actions. A handler is a controller method annotated with `@Subscribe` and having the event as a parameter.

Using delegates you can provide code that will be used by various screen mechanisms instead of their standard implementations. For example, you can provide your own function to commit data or to select icons for table rows. A delegate is a controller method with a specific signature and annotated with `@Install`.

You can create event handlers and delegates in Studio:

* by clicking the *Generate Handler* action on the top actions panel,
* or by pressing Alt+Insert (Cmd+N) and selecting *Generate Handler* in the *Generate* popup menu:

Each event or delegate in the window is provided with a description on the right which is extracted from the event's Javadoc.

The following events and delegates are available in the opened window:

* Controller handlers represent the lifecycle of the screen.

* Component handlers allow you to react on buttons clicks, table selections, actions etc.

* Frame handlers represent the lifecycle of the outer frame component of this screen.

* Data context handlers allow you to react on the data context changes and execute code before and after data commit.

* Data container handlers enable receiving notifications on changes in the state of data containers and entities.

* Data loader handlers enable implementing your own or customizing standard logic of loading data for screen components.
