==== Creating Managed Beans

Studio shows all {main_man_url}/managed_beans.html[managed beans] of the middle tier (including entity and transaction listeners) in the *Middleware > Beans* section of the project tree.

In order to create a new managed bean in the core module, select the *Middleware* -> *Beans* project tree section and click *New > Bean* in the context menu:

When you enter the name of the bean class, the corresponding bean name is generated automatically.

It is also possible to create a managed bean manually in other modules of the project. To do that, create a Java class by selecting a package in the project tree and clicking *New > Java Class* in the context menu. Then add the `@Component` annotation to the class as in the example above. To minimize the risk of name conflicts, especially if you are developing an application component, provide a name to the bean explicitly by specifying it in the annotation.
