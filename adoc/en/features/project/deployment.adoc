** *Include Tomcat's context.xml* - whether `context.xml` (Tomcat deployment descriptor) should be included in WAR file.

** *Custom context.xml path* - a path relative to the project root to the `context.xml` Tomcat deployment descriptor. Enabled if *Include Tomcat's context.xml* is checked. Click *Generate* to create this file automatically.

* *App properties* - a set of application properties to define for this deployment. The properties will be added to the `/WEB-INF/local.app.properties` file inside the WAR.
