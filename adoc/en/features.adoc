== Studio Features

This section of the documentation describes all Studio features that can help you in the developing CUBA applications. The information is mostly structured by the project elements which you see in the <<project_tree,project tree>>.

Some Studio features may conflict with those of IntelliJ Ultimate Edition or some third-party plugins. For example, to avoid conflicts of gutter icons, do the following to disable conflicting Ultimate icons:

* Select *Settings > Editor > General > Gutter Icons* in IDEA menu,

* Uncheck *Injection points* and *Producers for Disposer methods* options,

* Apply the changes.
