==== Generating Data Model

Studio allows you to create the data model and standard UI screens for an existing database. Click *CUBA > Advanced > Generate Model* main menu item or select *Project > Data Stores* in the project tree and click *Generate Model* in the context menu. If you have several data stores, Studio shows a dialog where you should select one.

Then Studio opens the *Generate Model from Database* wizard.

Step 1::

This is the first step of the model generation wizard.

Optional step: click image:gear_button.png[Settings] to set up a Java package where to create new entities, and default mappings for system attributes.

For example, if all or most of the tables in your database contain `Modified` and `ModifiedBy` columns, you can map them to `Updatable.updateTs` and `Updatable.updatedBy` attributes of created entities. In this case, you don't need to map them individually for each table. Use *Exclude columns from mapping* list to not map certain columns automatically for all tables.

The wizard displays the list of tables that have no corresponding entities in the project's data model. You can use the filter field above to find a table by its name.

Select tables that you want to map to the data model. Some tables depend on others through foreign keys, so when you select a table, all tables that it depends on are also become selected. If you deselect a table, all dependent tables become deselected too.

You can click on the checkbox on the right to select or deselect all available tables.

Click *Next*.

At this step, you can review and edit automatically generated mappings for the selected tables.

The *Status* column describes the result of the automatic mapping:

* *OK* - the automatic mapping was successful, and all columns are mapped to a new entity.
* *Join table* - a link between entities is recognized and mapped as a many-to-many join table.
* *There are unmapped columns* - some columns cannot be mapped to a new entity.
* *New PK will be created* - the table has no primary key. A new PK of UUID type will be created.
* *Composite PK will be replaced* - the table has a composite primary key, but no other tables reference it. The composite PK will be replaced by the primary key of UUID type.
* *Composite PK referenced by other tables* - the table has a composite primary key and some tables reference it. Studio cannot map such table.
* *Unsupported PK type* - the table has a primary key of an unsupported type. Studio cannot map such table.
* *Choose primary key for DB view* - it's a database view and you should select a column or a set of columns suitable for the entity identifier. In this case, click the *Choose PK* button and select columns for the primary key.

The image:refresh_button.png[Refresh mapping] button allows you to re-launch automatic mapping for the selected table. For example, you can go to a database SQL tool, make some changes in the database schema, then return to the wizard and launch the mapping procedure again.

The image:edit_button.png[Edit mapping] button opens a dialog window with the mapping details. There you can change the entity name and the list of system interfaces implemented by the entity class. It will affect the number of system columns being created for compatibility with CUBA entities.

The *Choose PK* button appears instead of *Edit mapping* when a database view is selected and you need to select columns for the entity identifier.

By clicking *Back*, you can go to the previous step to select or deselect tables.

Click *Next* to go to the next step.

Step 3::

--
At this step, you can specify what UI screens should be created for new entities.

image::features/data_model/generate_model_step3.png[align="center"]

If you deselect the *Create standard screen* checkbox, Studio will not generate UI for the new entities.

Use the *In module*, *Package* and *Menu* fields to specify where to place the screens source code and where to display them in the main menu.

Use the drop-down list in the *Standard screens* column to select what types of screens to generate.

You can safely skip this step and generate UI screens for your entities later after finishing the model generation process.

Click *Next* to go to the next step.

Step 4::

This is the last step of the model generation wizard.

//TODO insert screenshot

The *Import scripts* table contains the list of scripts that should be executed on the database to make it compliant with the entities being created.

Until this point, nothing is created in the project nor even saved to disk. Studio actually generates entities and screens and saves the scripts only when you press *Run all scripts* or *Run script*.

You can review and edit the scripts on this page, then run them or just save and run later by a database management tool. The import scripts are saved in the `modules/core/db/import` directory.
