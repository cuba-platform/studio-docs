=== Upgrading a Project

This section covers the process of upgrading a project to a newer CUBA version.

[TIP]
====
It is recommended to put the project under version control and commit all pending changes before upgrade. It will allow you to see what changes are performed and quickly roll back to a previous version if the upgrade fails for some reason.
====

* Open the project as described in the <<open_project,previous section>>.

* Click *CUBA > Project Properties* in the main menu or double-click *Project > Properties* in the CUBA project tree.

* In the *CUBA Project Properties* dialog, click the *Change...* link located near the *Platform version* label.

* The *Change Platform Version* dialog appears. Select the desired CUBA version in the drop-down field.

* For the purpose of beta-testing or early accessing new CUBA platform features you might want to use one of unstable CUBA platform versions, ones that end with `BETA` or `SNAPSHOT` suffixes. To see them in the platform version drop-down list, you need to select the *Show unstable versions* checkbox.
+
[TIP]
====
SNAPSHOT versions are available only if you use the `repo.cuba-platform.com` repository.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
Both `BETA` and `SNAPSHOT` versions are strongly not recommended for use in production.
====

* You can press the *Release Notes* link and navigate to the documentation page that describes new features, improvements and breaking changes in the API of the new platform version.

* If you are upgrading to a newer feature release (for example, from 6.10.X to 7.0.X or from 7.0.Y to 7.1.Y), the *Migration Required* section appears in the *Change Platform Version* dialog.
** By pressing the *More info...* link, you can open another dialog containing information about changes that will be automatically performed by the Studio to the project structure, build scripts or individual project files. Review the information.

* Click *OK* to confirm platform version upgrade, and click *OK* in the *Project Properties* dialog.

* Studio performs automatic migration (if needed) and runs Gradle `clean` and `undeploy` tasks.

* If you are upgrading to a feature release, review _Breaking Changes_ section in {rel_notes_url}[Release Notes] and make changes in your project accordingly.

* If your project includes *CUBA Add-ons*, you may need to update them to the appropriate version compatible with the new CUBA platform version:
** Open CUBA project tree -> *Project* -> *Add-ons*.
** Select *Updates* tab.
** Select all ready for update add-ons.
** Click *Apply & Close*.
** Wait until updated dependencies are downloaded and indexed.

* Try to assemble your project by executing *CUBA > Build Tasks > Assemble*. Watch the output and fix your code if it doesn't compile.

* Execute *CUBA > Update Database* to incorporate possible framework schema changes into your project's database.
