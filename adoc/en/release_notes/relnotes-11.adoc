. Implemented scaffolding of `EntityChangedEvent` listeners. In order to run it, select an entity class, package, or the top-level *Middleware* node in the CUBA project tree and click the *New > EntityChangedEvent Listener* context menu item. Studio will create a Spring bean in the `core` module with two listener methods: one notified before and another after transaction commit.
