=== CUBA Menu

The *CUBA* main menu provides quick access to the CUBA-specific features of the IDE. Some of the menu items duplicate the functionality available through the <<project_tree>> and its context menus.

You can add frequently used menu items to the main toolbar by clicking on the toolbar and selecting *Customize Menus and Toolbars*. In the *Menus and Toolbars* dialog, expand the *Main Toolbar* item and use *Add Action* command to add items from the *Main Menu > CUBA* tree.
