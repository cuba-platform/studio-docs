==== Managing Add-ons

The *CUBA Add-ons* dialog allows you to manage CUBA add-ons included in your project.
It can be opened:

* by double-clicking *Project* -> *Add-ons* in the CUBA project tree,
* from main menu: *CUBA* -> *Marketplace...*

The dialog has three tabs: *Marketplace*, *Installed* and *Updates*.

Clicking on Add-on title leads to the page with detailed overview, compatibility, licensing information:

In order to install one or more add-ons, press *Install* for the ones you're interested
and then click *Apply* or *Apply & Close* button.
After the confirmation Studio will make necessary changes to your project's build scripts and configuration files,
download new libraries and refresh Gradle project configuration.

Installing add-on by coordinates::

Add-on coordinates is simply a Gradle dependency string, e.g. "com.mycompany.cuba-addons:myaddon:0.1.5".
This string can be published on CUBA platform web site or by author of the add-on.
In order to install necessary add-on by coordinates (or by gradle dependency string),
click Gear icon located right to *Updates* tab header, and then choose *Install by coordinates*:

Installed add-ons are grouped into two categories.
*Marketplace Add-Ons* are those which are installed from CUBA Marketplace.
*Custom Add-Ons* are those which are developed by 3rd parties and hosted in 3rd-party repositories, including local Maven.

In order to detach add-on from your project, select corresponding item in the list and press *Delete*,
or right-click -> *Uninstall*.
Then click *Apply* in the dialog. Studio will remove the add-on from the list of project dependencies and update project configuration.
