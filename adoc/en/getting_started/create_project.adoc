=== Creating a New Project

CUBA Studio provides an easy way to create new CUBA projects from scratch. Just use the *New Project* wizard and follow the steps below:

. In the *Welcome to CUBA Studio* window click *Create New Project*, or use Main Menu -> *File* -> *New* -> *Project*.

. Select *CUBA Project*.

. Specify *Project namespace* â€“ the namespace which will be used as a prefix for entity names and database tables. The namespace can consist of Latin letters only and should be as short as possible. *Think carefully on the name at this stage*, as changing it later on will require complex manual intervention.

. Change *Root package* if necessary. It is the root (or base) package for Java classes. It can be adjusted later, but the classes generated at project creation will not be moved.

. Change *Module prefix* if required. Module names of the CUBA project are prepended with this prefix. Module prefix can be adjusted later.

. In the *Project SDK* field, select a JDK corresponding to `JAVA_HOME` which is set in your environment. If you see the `<No SDK>` value, click *New* and select the folder where the JDK is installed, for example `++C:\Java\jdk8u202-b08++` on Windows or `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk8u202-b08/Contents/Home` on macOS.

. Accept the default repositories configuration, or {main_man_url}/access_to_repo.html[customize] it for the project.

. Select the *Platform version* to be used in the project. If you don't have any specific requirements, use the latest released version.

. For the purpose of beta-testing or early accessing new CUBA platform features you might want to use one of unstable CUBA platform versions, ones that end with `BETA` or `SNAPSHOT` suffixes. To see them in the *Platform version* drop-down list, you need to select the *Show unstable versions* checkbox. Also note that `SNAPSHOT` releases are published only to the `repo.cuba-platform.com` artifact repository.

. Select value in the *Languages support* drop down field to change set of programming languages used in the project, or leave recommended *Java* value.

. Use the *Available locales* field to open the *Locales* editor dialog and add more supported locales to the project. You will be able to change them later if required.

. Click *Next*.

. On the second wizard step you can set up main data store properties, e.g. select local PostgreSQL database for the new project. These properties can be changed later.

. Click *Next*.

. Change value of the *Project name* field, if required. The name should contain only Latin letters, numbers and underscores.

. *Project location* is the path to the new project directory. You can select another directory by typing it in the field or clicking the ellipsis button next to the field.

. Click *Finish*. The empty project will be created in the specified directory, and Studio will start building the project information from Gradle files and indexing the project.

. When the project synchronization and indexing process is completed, you will see the CUBA project tree in the *Project* tool window.

. Open the *Gradle* tool window which is docked on the right side by default. Click the "wrench" icon (*Gradle Settings*) and select `Use JAVA_HOME` in the *Gradle JVM* field. If you don't see such item in the drop-down list, make sure you have set up your development environment correctly as described in the {main_man_url}/setup.html[Setup] section of the CUBA Developer's Manual. Click *OK*.

. Now you can start working with the project.
