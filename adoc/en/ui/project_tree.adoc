=== CUBA Project Tree

The CUBA Project Tree is designed to represent the project structure and its significant elements. It normally opens in the *Project* tool window on the left side of the IDE. You can always switch to the project tree using the *CUBA > Project Tree* <<ui_menu,main menu>> command or by selecting *CUBA* in the top drop-down list of the *Project* tool window.

The project tree contains the following elements:

* <<project_properties,Properties>> - lets you configure the basic settings of your project.

* <<add_ons,Add-ons>> - opens the screen to configure CUBA add-ons used in your project

* <<modules,Modules>> - displays all project modules.

* <<data_stores,Data Stores>> - displays and manages the list of {main_man_url}/data_store.html[data stores] the project is connected to.
By default there is only one `Main` data store.

Use the context menu opened by right-clicking on the tree elements to execute actions specific for this project element. For example, using the context menu of the *Data Model* item, you can generate database scripts, generate model from the database, and create new entity or enumeration:
