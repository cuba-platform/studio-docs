Using commercial CUBA add-ons requires you to have an add-on subscription. However, for the purpose of evaluation you can you install a trial version of the particular add-on (available for 30 days).

Detailed steps you need to perform in order to install the commercial add-on depend on specifics of how you paid for add-on subscription. Below the following installation scenarios are described using the *BProc* add-on as an example:

* <<addons_install_trial,Trial add-on version>>.
