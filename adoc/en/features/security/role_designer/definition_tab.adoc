* *Name* - enter the unique name of the role. It is a technical name that can be used later in the code.
* *Scope* - choose which type of the client role permissions should be applied to:
** *GENERIC_UI* - permissions are applied to the {main_man_url}/gui_framework.html[Generic User Interface].
** *REST* - permissions are applied to the {restapi_man_url}[REST API] client.
* *Default Role* - the role is assigned to new users automatically. This flag allows you to grant a certain set of permissions to each new user by default.
* *Super Role* - users having this role become super users with all permissions granted.
* *Description* - free text description of the role, it will be shown in the Role Browser and Editor screens of the running application.

[WARNING]
====
Note that role name identifies design-time roles in the database, therefore it should not be changed after the role has been assigned to any users (or a database migration will be required).
