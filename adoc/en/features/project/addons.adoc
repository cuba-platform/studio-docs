==== Managing Add-ons
Add-ons are publicly distributed full-stack libraries extending your project with additional functionality.
More information about add-ons and application components can be found in the
{main_man_url}/app_components_recipes.html[CUBA Developer's Manual].

The *CUBA Add-ons* dialog allows you to manage add-ons included in your project.
It can be opened:

* by double-clicking *Project* -> *Add-ons* in the CUBA project tree,
* from the Main Menu: *CUBA* -> *Marketplace...*

The dialog has three tabs: *Marketplace*, *Installed* and *Updates*.
